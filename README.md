## 🚀 "Expert-on-Device" Platform: Data Sovereignty and Strategic Differentiators

More than a simple "AI assistant", this is a **multimodal, configurable, and sovereign platform for professional applications**, designed for scale deployment and multiple monetization models.

- **🤖 LLM Agnostic & Edge Computing**: Swap models (OpenAI, Claude, Groq) dynamically via Web Portal or run an *On-Premise* LLM. Ensures **total privacy, data sovereignty** and no *vendor lock-in*.
- **💼 Expert Profiles (B2B)**: Deploy the behavior of "agronomists", "mechanics", or "tutors" on the same embedded hardware by simply changing the context. Creates high-value segmented product lines.
- **💸 Cost-Effective Hardware (< US$33)**: Based on ESP32-S3 (Lite) and P4 (Pro), ensuring extremely low CAPEX, enabling large-scale sales to industrial fleets, schools, and hospitals.
- **👁️ Multimodality + Local Auditing**: Combines voice and camera interaction in real time, while automated native logs on the SD Card handle institutional *compliance*.
- **🧩 Ecosystem and Licensing**: Modular firmware ready for OEM agreements. Enables recurring revenue by selling "expert profiles as a service" far beyond simple hardware sales.

| 🌐 Own server | **Optional (supports on-premise)** | Required |
| 🤖 AI Model | **Provider-agnostic (supports cloud or own LLM)** | Locked to 1 vendor |
| 📷 Computer Vision | **Yes — in the P4 Pro version** | Limited or cloud-dependent |
| 🎙️ Voice Processing | **Real-time, edge** | Cloud required |
| 🔐 **Data Privacy** | **Local processing (on-premise)** | Data on third-party servers |
| 🔋 Power consumption | **Ultra low (S3 Lite)** | High |
| 👕 **Wearable** | **✅ S3 Lite version** is optimized for this | ❌ Rare / dependent on proprietary ecosystem |
| 📦 Size | **Smaller than a deck of cards** | Desktop or server |

## 🔓 Open Architecture — LLM Agnostic

> **Current status:** The **ESP32-S3 Lite** firmware is now the **most advanced** in the project, being 100% dynamically LLM-agnostic — you can switch providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama) via Web without recompiling! The ESP32-P4 Pro version follows the same standard of excellence.

The firmware architecture was designed to support any provider via REST API. When implemented, you simply edit `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
    "model":    "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "token":    "sk-ant-...",
    "personality": "You are a technical specialist..."
  }
}
```

| Provider | Planned base_url | Target Models | Differentiator |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI** *(current)* | `api.openai.com/v1` | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` | Current project standard |
| **Anthropic** | `api.anthropic.com/v1` | `claude-3-5-sonnet` | Superior technical reasoning |
| **Groq** | `api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `llama-3-70b`, `mixtral` | Ultra-low latency |
| **OpenRouter** | `openrouter.ai/api/v1` | All of the above | One key for all |
| **Local (Ollama)** | `local-ip:11434/v1` | Llama 3, Mistral | Full offline privacy |

> 💡 **For enterprises:** With this feature implemented, it is perfectly feasible to point the ESP32-P4's `base_url` to an internal LLM server on the local network (e.g., Ollama) via the Web Portal, keeping audio and images under offline sovereignty without leaking data to the public internet!

> 🧠 **Multiple Profiles and Personalities:** All behavioral instructions filled in the Web Captive Portal will be combined with the physical expert profile rotated on the board, creating much more singular and unique agents. This data will be persistently saved on the MicroSD card via `settings.json`.

## 🧠 Expert-on-Device — The Concept that Changes Everything

<div align="center">

![Expert-on-Device — Multi-contextual physical assistant with native professional profiles](imagens/Expert_on_Device.jpeg)

</div>

**Expert-on-Device** is the core idea that differentiates this project from a simple "button that calls ChatGPT".

Instead of a generic assistant, the device **changes its behavior** according to the configured profile — like having a dedicated specialist for each use context:

| Profile | The device behaves like... | Usage Example |
|---|---|---|
| 🌾 **Agro** | Field agronomist | *"What are the best nutrients for tomatoes?"* — responds with dosage, timing, visual symptoms |
| 🎓 **Teacher** | Personalized tutor | *"Explain photosynthesis"* — adapts language to the student's level |
| 🗂️ **Meeting** | Executive secretary | *"Summarize what was decided"* — transcribes and synthesizes into bullet points |
| ⚙️ **Engineer** | Technical specialist | *"What is this component?"* (photo) — identifies and describes specifications |
| 🩺 **Health** | Clinical aide | *"Record: patient reports pain for 3 days"* — formats for medical records |
| 🔧 **General** | All-purpose assistant | Everyday use without specific context |

### Why is this revolutionary?

> Today, a doctor pays US$500/month for a transcription app. An agronomist flies for hours to give a field diagnosis. An engineer opens 800-page manuals to identify a failure.
>
> **With US$33 of hardware and this firmware, any professional carries the specialist in their pocket — no platform subscription, no cameras sending images to third-party servers.**

### How profiles work technically

Profiles are **system prompts** stored in the `settings.json` on the SD card, loaded at startup. Switching profiles = editing the `ai.personality` field and restarting — **no firmware recompilation needed**.

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "personality": "You are an agronomist specialized in tropical horticulture..."
  }
}
```

Want a fully customized profile for your business? Just edit `settings.json` — or configure it via the Captive Portal directly in the field.

## 🚀 The Firmware as a Portable "Brain"

The project's modular architecture allows the same logic — media capture, AI orchestration, and profile management — to be embedded in different form factors:

- **👓 Smart Glasses** — Embedded ESP32-S3 processes what the user sees in real time, responding via audio. Ideal for the Engineer profile in hands-free industrial maintenance.
- **⌚ Smartwatch / Wearables** — The low power consumption and small size of the S3 enable wearable devices for health or security, with Edge AI directly on the wrist.
- **⛑️ Smart Helmets and PPE** — The "Expert" profile integrated into a construction helmet can identify hazards by photo and alert the worker via local audio, without depending on a network.

> The hardware changes. The firmware stays the same.
